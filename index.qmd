## üìù What the ‚ÄúReport‚Äù Should Contain

Each report is meant to serve as a structured progress documentation that balances technical work and personal learning. You should:

1.	Summarize progress
	-	What was done since the last meeting? (e.g., data collection, preparation, exploration, modeling)
	-	What challenges were encountered?
2.	Evaluate methods
	-	Are chosen tools/approaches working well?
	-	What adjustments are needed?
3.	Document insights
	-	What new findings emerged from the data?
	-	What was learned about the research question so far?
4.	Plan ahead
	-	What are the next concrete steps before the next meeting?
	-	Identify support/resources needed.
5.	Personal takeaways
	-	Briefly reflect on skills gained (coding, data wrangling, communication, teamwork).
	-	How do these skills connect to the overall capstone or professional goals?
	

## ‚úçÔ∏è Assignments

- Research Kickoff Report
  - Research ideas, data sources, and first challenges
- Progress & Insights Report
  - What‚Äôs been done and early analyses
- Research Synthesis Report
  - Takeaways, limitations, lessons learned, and next steps for the final proposal

### üìë Components of the Final Proposal

1. Title & Abstract
	-	Concise project title.
	-	150‚Äì250 word abstract summarizing research question, data, methods, and expected contribution.

2. Introduction & Motivation
	-	Background on the problem/topic.
	-	Why it matters (business, economics, or policy relevance).
	-	Clear statement of research question(s).

3. Literature & Context (short)
	-	What have others done in this area?
	-	How does this project extend or differ?

4. Data
	-	Description of the dataset(s): source, size, variables, time period.
	-	How data were collected (APIs, scraping, public repositories, etc.).
	-	Any limitations (missing data, measurement error).

5. Methods / Analytical Approach
	-	What techniques will be used (e.g., regression, clustering, NLP, time-series)?
	-	Why are these methods appropriate?
	-	Any expected preprocessing steps (cleaning, transformations).

6. Preliminary Results / Exploration
	-	Early exploratory data analysis (EDA).
	-	Tables, summary statistics, or sample visualizations.
	-	Evidence the student/team has actually interacted with the dataset.

7. Timeline & Work Plan
	-	Breakdown of remaining work (analysis, visualization, writing).
	-	Roles and responsibilities if a team project.

8. Expected Contributions
	-	What new insights do you expect to generate?
	-	Who benefits from this research (scholars, firms, policymakers, the public)?

9. References
	-	Cited literature, data sources, and tools (APA or other standard).

10. Appendices (Optional)
	-	Extra figures, code snippets, or data dictionaries.
